<p align="justify">Known as the 'festival of colors', Holi is a jubilant celebration of spring's arrival. People smear each other with vibrant colors, dance, and enjoy traditional foods. The night before Holi, bonfires are lit to symbolize the destruction of the demon Holika, harking back to the legend of Prahlad and Hiranyakashipu.</p>
