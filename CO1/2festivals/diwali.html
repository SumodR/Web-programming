<p align="justify">One of the most popular Hindu festivals, Diwali or Deepavali, marks the victory of light over darkness and good over evil, commemorating Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile. During this 'festival of lights', homes are decorated with oil lamps or 'diyas', and colorful rangoli artworks. Firework displays are a common sight.</p>
