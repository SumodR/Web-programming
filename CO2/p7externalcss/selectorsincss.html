        CSS selectors are used to “find” (or select) the HTML elements you want to style. We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
    <p id="p1">Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class) Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them).</p>
<p id="p2">Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state).</p>
<p id="p3">Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element).</p>
<p id="p4">Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value).</p> 
<p id="p5">The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element! To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element..</p>
